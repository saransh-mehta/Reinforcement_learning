# Reinforcement_learning
In this project, Deep Q-Learning algorithm originally created by Deep Mind team to play the game of Cartpole. The agent tries to keep the pole standing by taking two actions, left or right. The agent runs episode by episode and learns from the reward. The deep neural network gets trained on the loss from Bellman equation.
loss = (r + Y max Q'(s,a') - Q(s,a))^2 
OpenAi's gym module has been used to create the agent environment for reinforcement learning along with keras for the Deep Q- Network.
